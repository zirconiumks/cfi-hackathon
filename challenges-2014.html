				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>The World Bank is currently financing the construction of many new shelters across the state of Odisha. Help ensure that in an emergency situation, safe spaces for sheltering exist - by creating a tool that can track the construction of new shelters, maintenance and reliability of existing shelters through constant (volunteer/citizen) reporting on the available equipment and facilities.

Surprisingly, not many many know about these contracts we’re investing in, even when they represent large amounts of public money meant for their neighbourhood.</p>

					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>Build an application for citizens to locate if a contract awarded out of World Bank funded project is for their neighbourhood, what is supposed to be delivered, and who got the contract.

					<p>The daily commute in Bangalore is often no joy-ride, an open trip planner based on open data standard can help office-goers plan (or imagine!) their trip on public transport, and planners analyze patterns.

				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Akshaya Patra currently serves more than 1.2 million meals daily through their network in 9 states in India. To ensure operational efficiency, each Kitchen should prepare meals in exact quantities everyday to prevent either shortage or wastage. This is currently done by collecting the approximate attendance estimates from teachers by the delivery staff. They also take feedback on the previous day’s quantities. However, the entire process is manual, time consuming and tedious. Teachers have no access to any mechanism to know how much food is required for consumption.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>To create an application that can predict the quantity of food required in each operational region based on the historical data. The application should make it easy for delivery teams to collect metrics and share them with the Kitchens. The Kitchens should be able to see prediction numbers for quantities of each part of the meal (e.g. 125 servings of Rice, 100 Servings of Dal etc). The application should be able to take attendance numbers on a daily basis and adjust the predictions for the next day.</p>

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>One important and underserved need is to analyze post-poll data, especially in regions where voter turnout is lower than estimated. Several discrepancies contribute to low voter turnout - from mistakes in the electoral rolls, to mismatched voter IDs and missing names on the polling days. It is not a trivial task to decipher the reasons why the turnout was low, and analyse how this can be avoided in the next elections. So there is a sincere need for a reliable voter analytics system for post-poll analysis.</p>

						Design a voter analytics framework and working prototype to understand the voter trends in Bangalore.

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Though electoral rolls without photographs are published as PDF files on the websites of various Chief Electoral officers (CEO), less than 10% of them are in English as per Election Commission’s (ECI) directives. The rest are published in local languages. We have extracted text from the English PDF files, analysed the quality and suggested solutions to various quality issues in the rolls. This helps ECI to focus their limited resources on reviewing a few thousand problematic rolls vs. trying to find anomalies and do verifications based on 800 mln voters.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>Develop a set of applications that can 1) Extract Indic text in Unicode from the PDF electoral rolls. 2) After extracting the Indic text, transliterate the contents to English.</p>

					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>A mobile-based application that will allow stakeholders (SMC members, NGO staff, Government officials) to track the status of infrastructure facilities in schools, like toilets, drinking water, barrier-free access etc., and provide feedback on their maintenance. This GPS enabled application will allow users to upload the photographs of the ground reality, and enter the status of the infrastructure from a list of available parameters. This information will automatically be uploaded to a website that will show updates for each school on a map, and generate heat-maps showing the status, and improvement, of school infrastructure across a state.</p>

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Children that go to government schools in India mostly don’t have access to hands-on knowledge to solve practical problems. They often lack entrepreneurial guidance or meta skills that’ll prepare them for the real world. Most girls drop out by Grade 10 in Bihar, so empowering kids with skills through games in Grade 9 equips them with skills they can use for a lifetime, to stay in school, create their own opportunities and change the world around them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>Going to School is a creative not-for-profit education trust based in New Delhi, India. We design stories to inspire children to learn skills at school: http://www.goingtoschool.com/ We believe in the power of stories to transform the way children learn and create their own opportunities. Through an MOU with the Government of Bihar, we reach 100,000 kids in Grade 9 with imperative skills education through stories. This is the first time we’re going to create games to be used on computers in schools to give children a whole new experience of the skill. We’d like to develop a creative and easy-to-learn game that’s aimed at developing entrepreneurial skills, especially in girls. In fact, we’d like to develop 12 games.</p>

					<p>At Digital Green, we train frontline workers in rural villages to asynchronously produce and screen videos to fellow farmers on techniques that can boost farm productivity. We are looking to build an interactive voice response (IVR) system to crowdsource feedback on the videos farmers like and those that they adopt.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
					<p>We propose to build an IVR-based polling system to survey farmers on whether they are interested or adopted the practices that they watched on video during the previous two months. This system would take our existing farmer data (including mobile numbers) and make automated outbound calls to farmers. Farmers could press touchtone numbers (e.g., “1” for interested, “2” for not interested”). If a farmer selects the “interested” option, the farmer would then be asked whether they adopted the practice on their farm. A REST API would be developed to link the IVR survey data with our existing farmer database.</p>

					<p>Despite millions spent on AIDS awareness campaigns, a significant lack of knowledge about HIV and AIDS persists.

This is particularly true in India, with the third largest HIV-positive population globally.</p>

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Victims have a very short time to react when they are in the situations of distress. Usually they resort to calling out for help with display of physical resistance. Such a call for help may or may not be heard depending on the location and surroundings of the incident. Most of the time, the trusted family and friends, are far away from the location where the call for help can be heard. This results in situations where rescue of the victim becomes very difficulty and maintaining their safety is highly unlikely.</p>

					<p>The aim is to create an application that can be triggered with the minimum number of steps to initiate a distress call. The distress call sends our alerts to a selected group of family, friends and under certain conditions also to local emergency services. The app should be smart to reach out for help to people who are most likely to be nearby. It should be extensible to also record location data since the time the distress call was initiated and closed.</p>
