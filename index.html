					<div class="clear"></div>
					<div class="eight columns">
						<p class="headline">Original Code</p>
						<p>All code must be original. We request all participants to start coding together at the start of the event. This is to make things fair. Designs, mockups, open source libraries and research with use of resources that are available to everyone is fair. However, please use your best judgement and keep things within limit.</p>
						<p>In the spirit of the hackathon, work should be completed in the designated hacking zones at the Google campus. If you need to hack elsewhere, let one of the organizers know.</p>
						<p class="headline">Team Size</p>
						<p>Teams can consist of up to 4 humans. 1 non-human member, such as a drone, sphere or a bot are allowed.</p>
						<p class="headline">Project Review</p>
						<p>Teams that are declared as winners will be subject to a thorough Project Review including code and all other resources they might have used. This maybe right before or after the event, or scheduled at a later time. Respective teams will be informed of details.</p>
						<p class="headline">Pre-existing Contractual Agreements</p>
						<p>Participants may have pre-existing employee clauses, or any prior contracts that they might have entered into before the event (example: Non-disclosure agreements, ownership and licensing of code that’s written by an employee in her/his spare time, non-compete clauses, invention assignments, patents, etc.). The participants hold full responsibility to adhere to any such pre-existing agreements. Code for India and the NGO’s (Challenge Partners) are not responsible or liable for any infringements.</p>

						<p>In general, all the code produced during the Hackathon will be the responsibility of the teams and its members, and is required to be released under the Apache 2.0 license, which allows for open-sourcing of code, attribution, and subsequent improvements, if required. However, data sources, workflows, problem definitions, potential solutions and other information that have been provided by our NGO Partners are under sole ownership of the respective organizations. If you wish to continue working with the data obtained during the Hackathon, please obtain explicit permissions from our NGO Partners independently. Code for India is not responsible for violation or unfair use of information available at the event.</p>
						<p>If the project team has signed a specific agreement with the Challenge Partners, that agreement will override this general rule of ownership. Code for India does not claim responsibility for the terms of these agreements, and their execution.</p>

					<p class="headline"> The India Hackathon at Stanford, 2013</p>
					<p>With 144 attendees, 20 challenges and 15 teams, the India Hackathon at the Stanford University  on October 5, 2013 successfully brought like-minded people together to work on solutions to real problems on the field through cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

					<p>With a opening statement from Karl Mehta, founder of Code for India and a keynote address from Ram Shriram, board member at Google, the event kick-started with a resonating call towards action that stuck with the teams for the rest of the day.</p>

					<p>We were fortunate to have amazing support from The Center for South Asia at Stanford and the Stanford India Association, as well as our technical partners - Google, Amazon and Intel Capital. Our challenge partners - Akshaya Patra, World Bank, Swaniti, Ubuntu at Work, Archive of Indian Music, Parishudh, She++, Healing Fields Foundation, and CDDRL at Stanford - gave us crucial insights to their work on the field, lending us direction in our approach towards tangible solutions.</p>

					<p class="headline">Vote for a Better India</p>
					<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ivoteforabetterindia.in">I vote for a better India</a> was built with the aim of registering millions of eligible citizens as voters for the upcoming elections in 2014. The CFI team worked in collaboration with the non-profit: Overseas volunteers for a better India to build a website and an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ovbi.voterregistration">Android-based mobile app</a> to simplify the voter registration process.</p>

					<p><iframe width="100%" height="250px" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fmx9poQ9bVM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

					<p>VBI has partnered with CELL, NASCOMM, FICCI, and CII who have approximately 36 lakh employees to get registered as voters. As a result, they launched an exclusive campaign called <a href="http://indiavoting.org">indiavoting.org</a> that has received a lot of press coverage: <a target="_blank" href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/vote-for-a-better-india-app-for-android-released-to-aid-voter-registration-462508">NDTV</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6KxZsmVnVI&feature=youtu.be">CNBC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/441965/register-to-vote-a-network-18-campaign.html">CNN IBN</a>, and other regional press like TV18 and Dainik Bhaskar Vidarbha.</p>

					<p><em>"Code For India brought the volunteers together to build the technology platform for speeding up voter registration and provided a great platform to build it rapidly. We can't thank CFI enough for its unique platform to empower NGO's to get technology developed"</em><br/> -- Satej Chaudhary, Overseas Volunteer for a Better India (OVBI), Partner NGO</p>

					<p class="headline">Spotter</p>
					<p>Spotter is a web application that makes the reporting of civic infrastructure problems simpler for citizens. The point, shoot, report process makes it easy for any mobile using to file a report and place it on the map. This helps to mobilize crowd-sourcing of information and allows civic action groups to collect data to initiate action from the government municipality agencies. The system also delivers the latest online reports in a simple and transparent interface with photographic proof, with the intent to close the loop on reported problems and bring accountability into the citizen-NGO-government network.</p>

					<p>Spotter has partnered with BPAC (Bangalore Political Action Committee), an active NGO that works with the municipality agencies to close the loop on these reports. With insights into user behavior, government processes and expected metrics, the next version of Spotter will bring richer functionality and intelligence into the system.
